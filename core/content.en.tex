	A free, lightweight pen-and-paper role playing game by \ludusleonis.

	\nipajin\ is designed for playing short campaigns or one-shots, is pronounced \say{nep-atshin} and is an acronym for a German phrase that translates to \say{Nobody is perfect, but everybody can contribute}. It provides shared spotlight between characters without smothering them into a tight rule-set.

\renewcommand{\nipajinHeadlinePlayer}{Player's Rules}
\renewcommand{\nipajinTocPlayer}{Player's Rules}
\renewcommand{\nipajinTextPlayer}{%
	\noindent
	Each \keyword{character} starts on a blank sheet of A4 or letter landscape sized paper. A straight line splits this \keyword{character sheet} in a left and a right half. The right half is subdivided in an upper and a lower area.

	Players write a basic description of their character into the left area: name, ethnicity and appearance, followed by a \keyword{background}. It does not matter whether if this is done in points or as prose. However, the description should focus on the character's  history, not what they can do well -- the game master will decide that later on. The background would rather state \say{worked as remover} instead of \say{is strong}. Players and game master agree on \keyword{Equipment} (\refPage{labelEquipment}) and \keyword{powers} (\refPage{labelEffects}) as they see fit.

	Now a d4, d6, d8, d10 and d12 are placed on the upper right area of the character sheet. The player picks one as  \keyword{hit die} (\HD) and moves it, highest number up, into the left area. If this die is ever reduced below 1, the character drops out of the game.

	\mysection[labelTaskresolution]{Task resolution}

		\noindent
		As long as everyone agrees on the outcome, the plot moves along freely between players and game master. When the outcome of an \keyword{action} is unclear, the player picks an \keyword{available die} from the upper right area of his character sheet and rolls it. On a natural one the attempt is an \keyword{automatic failure}. Otherwise a \keyword{modifier} is added to the roll, derived by the game master from the character's background.

		\nipajinTableModifier

		\noindent
		The action succeeds if the total equals or exceeds a \keyword{target number} (\TN) set by the game master. There is no automatic failure if the total is a one, but that it will rarely be sufficient.

		\nipajinTableTargets

		\noindent
		After the roll the now \keyword{exhausted die} is placed in the lower right area of the character sheet. If the game master derived a new a modifier, it should be noted down to avoid having to do that again, \eg~\say{Run+1}.

		Dice without chance of success may not be used and thus not be exhausted. A character might repeat a failed action of his  own or from others, but \TN~raises by 1 for each attempt.

		When all dice of a character are exhausted, he can't take any more actions. The character has to \keyword{take a deep breath} and pause or a short period of time, as defined by the game master. After that, the dice become available again and are put back into the upper right area.

	\mysection[labelConflict]{Conflicts}

		\noindent
		Conflicts are measured in \keyword{rounds}, their length being determined by the game master. Each round each character can attempt one action, \eg\ attack, and may react to each of his enemie's actions, \eg\ parry. Enemies can be defeated by reducing their \HD\ below 1, either with or without violence.

		At the start of each round each player simultaneously chooses an \keyword{action die} (\AD) and a \keyword{reaction die} (\RD) out of his available dice. Those dice are used to resolve all actions and reactions this round. Players may choose to forgo either die if they wish. Surprised characters must not get a \AD\ during the first round. Only players without any available dice left may skip a round to take a deep breath.

		The action die also presents the \keyword{order} within a round. Dice with fewer sides act first (\eg\ a d6 acts before a d8), ties are resolved randomly.

		An attack succeeds if the aggressor's \AD\ exceeds the defender's \RD. If either rolls a natural one, their opponent succeeds automatically. A successful attack results in a \keyword{wound} and reduces the enemie's \HD\ by 1. Non-lethal actions also help to overcome enemies. If successful, they result in \keyword{trauma}, which is represented by game tokens placed on the character sheet.

		If the \HD~of a character drops below 1, or if the number of trauma tokens reach the current value of the \HD, the character is overcome (dead, intimidated,~\ldots).

		Characters can neglect their defense by not choosing a \RD. If so, they are allowed to announce \keyword{multiple actions} up to half of the maximum value of their \AD~(two for a d4, three for a d6,~\ldots). This includes, among others: two-handed attacks, double-shots, area attacks like sweeping blows or fireballs, intimidating groups of enemies or a timed sequence of other actions. \emph{All} actions are modified by \makebox{-2} per additional action or target beyond one. Each action triggers its own reaction.

		Finally, characters may \keyword{defend others} if they did not choose a \AD\ and react on behalf of others up to half the maximal value of their \RD. The defended character must be in reach and the defending character risks all the damage on failure.

	\mysection[labelEquipment]{Equipment}

		\noindent
		There is no equipment table. Ordinary weapons cause one wound per hit, special or magical weapons cause two wounds, fire and explosions cause three to four wounds. Improvised equipment results in a modifier of \makebox{-1} when rolling the \AD. Armor offers a modifier of \makebox{+1} or \makebox{+2} to the \RD.

	\mysection[labelHeal]{Healing}

		\noindent
		After each \keyword{full night's rest} players refresh their dice. Characters may also attempt to heal their wounds. Their players roll the \HD\ -- if the result is higher than the original value, it becomes the new value, otherwise the \HD\ remains unchanged.

		The game master decides how and when \keyword{trauma} heals. Psychological damage from being threatened or intimidated might last no longer than the end of the encounter. Phobias, curses and such might haunt the characters for days or even weeks to come.

\renewcommand{\nipajinHeadlineEffects}{Powers}
\renewcommand{\nipajinTocEffects}{Powers}
\renewcommand{\nipajinTextEffects}{\zlabel{labelEffects}%

	\noindent
	Magic effects, miracles, PSI, super powers or other supernatural abilities are called \keyword{powers}. Players define their character's powers during character creation. Usually each scenario that features supernatural abilities will have its own rules, but they might refer to the following \nipajin\ default mechanism:

	To unleash a power, a character needs to concentrate or gesture for a \keyword{preparation time} (\PT). If an effect has a \keyword{variable} \PT, the player can define it as needed right before using that power, \eg~\say{one minute}. At the end of the \PT\ the player makes his roll, taking the usual \makebox{-2} into account if multiple targets are affected. Each victim may react to avoid the power entirely. For objects and powers without victims the game master defines the \TN. On a success the power lasts as long as its defined \keyword{duration time} (\FT).

	\keyword{Melee attack powers} behave like ordinary weapons, \eg\ \emph{icy touch} or \emph{ghost sword}. Each hit results in one wound. \PT:~1~round; \FT:~permanent

	\keyword{Ranged attack powers} behave like ordinary ranged weapons and consume a physical resource of some kind per use, \eg\ a \emph{magic missile} might need powder or a small gem, \emph{fireball} an alchemical grenade. \PT:~1~round; \FT:~permanent

	\keyword{Knock-out powers} prevent victims from acting, \eg\ \emph{sleep}, \emph{petrification}, \emph{fear} oder \emph{banish}. \PT:~variable; \FT:~invested \PT

	\keyword{Support powers} helps a living being or improves an object in one facet, \eg\ \emph{fire resistance}, \emph{featherfall}, \emph{barrier} oder \emph{light}. \PT:~variable; \FT:~invested \PT

	\keyword{Transformations} slowly change or move dead matter or feelings, \eg\ \emph{water-to-wine}, \emph{charm} oder \emph{telekinesis}. \PT:~variable; \FT:~invested \PT

	\keyword{Illusions} deceive a single sense on a specific detail, \eg\ \emph{fool's gold}, \emph{phantom sound} oder \emph{invisibility}. \PT:~variable; \FT:~invested \PT

	\keyword{Divinations} unearth hidden facts, \eg\ \emph{detect magic}, \emph{clairvoyance} oder \emph{danger sense}. \PT:~one minute for the current, one hour for the past, one day for the future; \FT:~--

	\keyword{Healing powers} cure illnesses or poisons and close wounds. \PT:~one hour per wound, one day per illness; \FT:~permanent

\renewcommand{\nipajinHeadlineGM}{Game Master's Rules}
\renewcommand{\nipajinTocGM}{Game Master's Rules}
\renewcommand{\nipajinTextGM}{%
	\mysection[labelPCs]{Backgrounds}

		\noindent
		A player character's (PC) background is of special importance in \nipajin. A good background includes childhood, education and what the PC did the last few years. A dramatic life experience or two complete the picture. The PC's age and looks should also be noted down.

		Your group decides how formal the background description needs to be. In any case, it should offer sufficient information to derive a PC's strengths and weaknesses, as the game master (GM) has to base the decision how easy or difficult an action is on that. Gaps in the background should be closed as soon as possible, preferably during character generation. Scenarios usually define a few modifiers for pre-generated PCs -- they may of course be amended.

	\mysection[labelGroups]{Teamwork}

		\noindent
		Occasionally some or all PCs will \keyword{team up} to fulfill a goal that is beyond the reach of any single character. Their players each choose an \AD. They then agree on a leader. The leader rolls first and decides whether the result counts for the team. If the leader decides that a better result might be achieved by another player, leadership is handed over, the next player tries, and so forth. Each roll supersedes the previous one. A roll of a natural one at any point means that the group's attempt has ended in failure. Only dice that actually were rolled become exhausted.

		If PCs team up during a conflict, their order is defined by their slowest member. Any opponent has to defend against the final result with a single roll of his \RD. If he loses, he takes the wounds each team member would have made individually. You can't combine team up and multiple actions.

		\keyword{Long-term activities} require high target numbers, \eg\ \say{repair\TN20}. The PCs have to work multiple rounds to reach this number. Each round has a length set by the GM. All participating PCs team up as described above. Each round's result is added up until the \TN\ is reached. A rolled natural one only foils one round, not the long-term activity itself.

	\mysection[labelNSCs]{Non-Player Characters}

		\noindent
		The game master will represent several friends and foes the group is going to interact with. Those non-player characters (NSCs) use simplified rules. In addition to their looks and motivation to interact with PCs, they are only given a \HD, a single \AD\ and a single \RD\ based on their danger level. Those dice might include half-dice like d2 or d3.

		\nipajinTableNSC

		\noindent
		In addition to the danger level, each creature might get some predefined modifiers, \eg\ \say{Fight+1} or \say{Agility-2}. However, don't mix high danger levels and high modifiers or they will get too tough.

		NSCs have the advantage to never run out of \AD/\RD\ and thus never need to refresh. In return, they should be slightly less powerful than player characters. Also, trauma is not as important for them and is deducted directly from their \HD.

	\mysection[labelBestiary]{Bestiary}

		\noindent
		The following example creatures should not be seen as indication that \nipajin\ is only a classic fantasy game.

		\nipajinTableBestiary

	\mysection[labelXP]{Experience}

		\noindent
		The PCs define the power level of the setting. If the group consists of typical fantasy heroes, the bestiary contains NSCs with suitable competence. If PCs are goblins, a typical human hero running havoc in their lair would be already as powerful as a troll. The GM therefore should compare PCs and NPCs relatively to each other.

		\nipajin\ is not designed to see PCs grow over the course of a long campaign. Should a significant period of time pass in the game world, the GM nonetheless might raise the modifier of a PC if that sounds reasonable. Should PCs become superheroes overnight, this should not be reflected in raising the characters modifier's. The GM should change the world instead.
