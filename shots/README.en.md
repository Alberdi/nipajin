## Introduction

NIPâ€™AJIN Shots are very short role playing scenarios, max. two pages long and designed to be played in about 2 hours. They are suited for ...

* for demos on conventions,
* for first-time role payers, and
* when no time is left to prepare something else.

## Quickstart

Each subdirectory contains all necessary files for one shot. Running

```
shot-name$ make de
```

will generate a German version of the shot as PDF into an `out` folder.

Other available languages can be found by looking into the `Makefile`.
