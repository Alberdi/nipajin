## Introduction

NIP'AJIN Solos are short scenarios for one player that do not need a game master.

## Quickstart

Each subdirectory contains all necessary files for one solo scenario.. Running

```
solo-name$ make en
```

will generate a English version of the scenario (if available) as PDF into an `out` folder.

Other available languages can be found by looking into the `Makefile`.
